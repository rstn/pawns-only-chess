# Pawns only chess
Two-player program for chess variant where board contains only pawns

привет всем, первый опыт найти и изменить репозиторий в гите, вроде успешно

The white pawns are denoted with the capital W, the black pawns are the capital B characters.

A unique pair of coordinates (a letter and a number) identifies each square of the chessboard. From White's left to right, the squares in the vertical lines are called files. They are labeled from a to h. The horizontal lines, known as ranks, are numbered from 1 to 8. These are legit coordinate pairs: a2, c6, d8, h5, and so on. This corresponds to the chess algebraic notation for recording moves in chess.

The Pawns-only chess has very simple rules. The pawns can make any standard pawn moves, except promotion. A player wins the game when one of the pawns reaches the opponent's last row, or if all opponent pawns are captured. A draw occurs when one of the players is unable to make a valid move. This is called a stalemate.

## Examples

```
Example 1: White wins by moving a pawn across the whole board
